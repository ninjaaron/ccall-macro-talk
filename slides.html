# Introducing the `@ccall` Macro

---
class: middle

# Feature Overview

- More intuitive, "Julian" syntax
- Allows the use of varags of differing types
- Checks that function pointers are instances of `Ptr{Cvoid}`
- Anti-feature: No support for choosing the LLVM calling conventions

---

# Julian Syntax
calling this c function:

```C
size_t strlen(char *)
```

goes from this:

```julia
ccall(:strlen, Csize_t, (Cstring,), "foobar")
```

to this:

```julia
@ccall strlen("foobar"::Cstring)::Csize_t
```

- Function name is used with call syntax (`library.function_name()`
  where the function name can't be resolved in the current process)
- Arguments types are attached to their arguments.
- Return types go after the call syntax (as with Julia function
  declarations)

# Varargs

Varargs of different types now work (previously, all varargs had to be
of a single type. 

```julia
julia> foo = 10
10

julia> @ccall printf("%s = %d\n"::Cstring ; "foo"::Cstring, foo::Cint)::Cint
foo = 10
9
```

Jameson Nash did all the work with the LLVM interface and parser to
make this possible. I just implemented the syntax transformation.

# Sanity checks on function pointers:

```julia
julia> not_function = pointer("foo")
Ptr{UInt8} @0x00007fd9a019adf8

julia> @ccall $not_function()::Cvoid
ERROR: ArgumentError: interpolated function `not_function` was not a Ptr{Cvoid}, but Ptr{UInt8}
```

This is implemented as a runtime check, but it should compile out with
dead branch elimination in many cases.

# No Support for LLVM Calling Conventions

There is a little-used, optional second argument to `ccall`---the LLVM
calling convention:

```julia
julia> ccall(:strlen, stdcall, Csize_t, (Cstring,), "foobar") |> println
6
```
The `@ccall` macro has no support for this. Originally there was, and
there are still hooks for it in the code, but reviewers thought it was
cleaner to leave it out for now.

If you need it, you could do your own like this:

```julia
macro ccall2(call, convention=:ccall)
    return Base.ccall_macro_lower(convention, Base.ccall_macro_parse(expr)...)
end
```

# Origin Story

---

class: middle

I just wanted Julia syntax for `ccall`, but I wasn't sure where it
would be better to put the return type, so I posted on the forum.

https://discourse.julialang.org/t/wrote-a-macro-to-make-ccall-look-a-little-more-like-julia-need-an-opinion-on-the-return-type-placement/19373/13

- Stefan mentioned he had proposed something like this earlier for
  `Base`.
- Chris Foster said he _still_ interested in having something like
  this in `Base`. They suggested I make it a package to get it
  polished up before making a pull request.
- Also worth noting that a fair amount of the thread has to do with
  how `varargs` should be handled.

Here's the repo, for posterity:
https://github.com/ninjaaron/CcallMacros.jl

It contains some other toys that are not very interesting.

- I worked on it a little and then did nothing for a year.
- I went to JuliaCon 2019 and got inspired to actually get the PR done
  in the hackathon.
- Didn't quite finish it, but I got a lot of advice from the core
  developers.
- Once again, the handling of varargs was discussed. Jameson said I
  should base it on the underlying `foreigncall` rather than `ccall`,
  and I would just have to patch the parser and the llvm interface a
  bit to get it working.
- Little did he know, I don't know C++ or Scheme.

So I made the pull request the week after the conference ended. (only
with support for varargs of the same type, like `ccall`).

https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/32748

- There was much discussion and some really helpful and thorough code
  review (especially from Chris Foster, who kind of shepherded the
  whole thing).
- More tests were written.
- Return of the varargs discussion. I told Jameson that I wasn't
  really the person to be digging around in the parser. He graciously
  implemented all the backend changes necessary to support varargs of
  different types. (Which amounts to a good deal more code than what I
  wrote for the whole PR)
- I rebased the whole thing on `foreigncall` rather than `ccall` to
  exploit this functionality.
- after poking around for two and a half months, the PR was finished.

Then nothing happened for four months. I think the core devs were
working on getting a release ready or something and the PR fell by the
wayside...

class: middle

- @Gnimuc piped up in February of this year and suggested something be
  done.
- Core devs triaged it and it was pulled into master within a week.
- It's now available in Julia 1.5
